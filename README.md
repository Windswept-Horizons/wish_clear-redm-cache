# wish_clear-redm-cache
BAT file to make clearing RedM cache quick and easy!

To make it easier for folks to clear their RedM cache or their RedM NUI cache, I created this BAT file that gives a choice to clear the RedM cache or the RedM NUI cache.

**How to use this bat file:**
1) Save the ZIP to your desktop or other location to find.
2) Unzip the folder.
3) Go into the folder.
4) Then double click "wish_clear redm cache_nui".


DISCLAIMER: 
This BAT file will only work if your RedM is installed on your C-drive in the default location. 
If your RedM is installed in a different directory, you will need to modify the BAT to point to that locations.
