NOTE: If you want to see what the BAT will do, simply right-click and select "Edit" and it will open with Notebad or your default text editor.

_DISCLAIMER:_ 
_This BAT file will only work if your RedM is installed on your C-drive in the default location._ 
_If your RedM is installed in a different directory, you will need to modify the BAT to point to that location._
